Task Overview :  <br/>
I carefully read and understood the assignment instructions, focusing on extracting a specific page from the existing React project.

Setting Up Environment :  <br/>
I created a new React app using Vite to set up the development environment.
# npm create vite@latest dashboard
# npm run dev

Analyzing Existing Code:  <br/>
I thoroughly examined the codebase of the original project to understand its structure, components, and dependencies.

Identifying Target Page :  <br/>
I pinpointed the designated page that needed to be extracted and made it the central focus of the extraction process.

Organizing Dependencies : 
I imported the necessary dependencies from the original project into the new React app to ensure the extracted page's functionality.

Structuring Components :  <br/>
I organized the components of the target page within the new project according to the prescribed repository format.

Refactoring Codebase :  <br/>
I refactored the codebase, rearranging and cleaning it up to adhere to the required repository structure.

Removing Redundancy :  <br/>
I eliminated any redundant code, such as unused functions or files, to optimize the project's efficiency and maintainability.

Testing and Validation : <br/>
I conducted thorough testing to validate that the extracted page functioned correctly within the new standalone project.

Optimizing for Time :  <br/>
To meet the given timeframe, I made necessary adjustments and compromises while ensuring completion of all tasks.
